About Eleni Koureas Consulting 

What I do
I offer support in global brand expansion through wholesale channels. This can include anything from the initial stages of range planning through to sourcing international sales representatives, providing advise on trade shows, selling directly to key market players or reviewing other growth opportunities i.e collaborations or diffusion lines.
I also offer guidance with commodity rates and taxes, international wholesale pricing, seasonal forecasting, building budgets and managing wholesale stocks. 

Who I am 

I established the wholesale division at Isabella Oliver in 2011 and within 3 years we successfully launched internationally with one of the largest retailers in the maternity sector, along with department stores in the UK and overseas, and multiple leading independants.
I've used this experience to develop strong account relationships with some of the largest key brands in retail such as Asos, Bentalls, Destination Maternity, House of Fraser, John Lewis, Mamas & Papas, Mothercare and Nordstrom.
